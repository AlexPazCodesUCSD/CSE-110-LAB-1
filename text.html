          Barry, I told you,
          stop flying in the house!
          (Barry drives through the hive,and is waved at by Adam who is reading a
          newspaper)
          BARRY==

          ADAM:
          - Hey, Barry.

           :
          - Is that fuzz gel?
          BARRY:
          - A little. Special day, graduation.
          ADAM:
          Never thought I'd make it.
          (Barry pulls away from the house and continues driving)
          BARRY:
          Three days grade school,
          three days high school...
          ADAM:
          Those were awkward.
          BARRY:
          Three days college. I'm glad I took
          a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
          ADAM==
          You did come back different.
          (Barry and Adam pass by Artie, who is jogging)
          ARTIE:
          - Hi, Barry!
          
          BARRY:
          - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

          Don't waste it on a squirrel.
          Such a hothead.
          ADAM:
          I guess he could have
          just gotten out of the way.
          (The car does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and lands on the
          highway)
           :
          I love this incorporating
          an amusement park into our regular day.
          BARRY:
          I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.
          (Barry parallel parks the car and together they fly over the graduating
          students)
          Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
          under the circumstances.
          (Barry and Adam sit down and put on their hats)
           :
          - Well, Adam, today we are men.

          can work for your whole life.
           :
          Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
          Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
           :
          Our top-secret formula
           :
          is automatically color-corrected,
          
          scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured
           :
          into this soothing sweet syrup
           :
          with its distinctive
          golden glow you know as...
          EVERYONE ON BUS:
          Honey!
          (The guide has been collecting honey into a bottle and she throws it into
          the crowd on the bus and it is caught by a girl in the back)
          ADAM:
          - That girl was hot.
          BARRY:
          - She's my cousin!
          ADAM==
          - She is?
          BARRY:
          - Yes, we're all cousins.
          ADAM:
          - Right. You're right.
          TOUR GUIDE:
          - At Honex, we constantly strive
           :
          to improve every aspect
          of bee existence.
           :
          These bees are stress-testing
          a new helmet technology.
          (The bus passes by a Bee wearing a helmet who is being smashed into the
          ground with fly-swatters, newspapers and boots. He lifts a thumbs up but
          you can hear him groan)
           :
          ADAM==
          
          - What do you think he makes?
          BARRY:

          TOUR GUIDE:
          Here we have our latest advancement,
          the Krelman.
          (They pass by a turning wheel with Bees standing on pegs, who are each
          wearing a finger-shaped hat)
          Barry:
          - Wow, What does that do?
          TOUR GUIDE:
          - Catches that little strand of honey
           :
          that hangs after you pour it.
          Saves us millions.
          ADAM:
          (Intrigued)
          Can anyone work on the Krelman?
          TOUR GUIDE:
          Of course. Most bee jobs are
          small ones.
          But bees know that every small job,
          if it's done well, means a lot.
           :
          But choose carefully
           :
          because you'll stay in the job
          you pick for the rest of your life.
          (Everyone claps except for Barry)
          BARRY:
          The same job the rest of your life?
          I didn't know that.
          ADAM:
          
          What's the difference?
          TOUR GUIDE:
          You'll be happy to know that bees,
          as a species, haven't had one day off
           :
          in 27 million years.
          BARRY:
          (Upset)
          So you'll just work us to death?
           :
          We'll sure try.
          (Everyone on the bus laughs except Barry. Barry and Adam are walking back
          home together)
          ADAM:
          Wow! That blew my mind!
          BARRY:
          "What's the difference?"
          How can you say that?
           :
          One job forever?

           :
          Our top-secret formula

          into this soothing sweet syrup
           :
          with its distinctive
          golden glow you know as...
          EVERYONE ON BUS:
          Honey!
          (The guide has been collecting honey into a bottle and she throws it into
          the crowd on the bus and it is caught by a girl in the back)
          ADAM:
          - That girl was hot.
          BARRY:
          - She's my cousin!
          ADAM==
          - She is?
          BARRY:
          - Yes, we're all cousins.
          ADAM:
          - Right. You're right.
          TOUR GUIDE:
          - At Honex, we constantly strive
           :
          to improve every aspect
          of bee existence.
           :
          These bees are stress-testing
          a new helmet technology.
          (The bus passes by a Bee wearing a helmet who is being smashed into the
          ground with fly-swatters, newspapers and boots. He lifts a thumbs up but
          you can hear him groan)
           :
          ADAM==
          
          - What do you think he makes?
          BARRY:

          (They pass by a turning wheel with Bees standing on pegs, who are each
          wearing a finger-shaped hat)
          Barry:
          - Wow, What does that do?
          TOUR GUIDE:
          - Catches that little strand of honey
           :
          that hangs after you pour it.
          Saves us millions.
          ADAM:
          (Intrigued)
          Can anyone work on the Krelman?
          TOUR GUIDE:
          Of course. Most bee jobs are
          small ones.
          But bees know that every small job,
          if it's done well, means a lot.
           :
          But choose carefully
           :
          because you'll stay in the job
          you pick for the rest of your life.
          (Everyone claps except for Barry)
          BARRY:
          The same job the rest of your life?
          I didn't know that.
          ADAM:
          
          What's the difference?
          TOUR GUIDE:
          You'll be happy to know that bees,
          as a species, haven't had one day off
           :
          in 27 million years.
          BARRY:
          (Upset)
          So you'll just work us to death?
           :
          We'll sure try.
          (Everyone on the bus laughs except Barry. Barry and Adam are walking back
          home together)
          ADAM:
          Wow! That blew my mind!
          BARRY:
          "What's the difference?"
          How can you say that?
           :
          One job forever?
          That's an insane choice to have to make.</div>

          Bee Movie
          By Jerry Seinfeld
          
          NARRATOR:
          (Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)
          According to all known laws
          of aviation,
           :
          there is no way a bee
          should be able to fly.
           :
          Its wings are too small to get
          its fat little body off the ground.
           :
          The bee, of course, flies anyway
           :
          because bees don't care
          what humans think is impossible.
          BARRY BENSON:
          (Barry is picking out a shirt)
          Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
          Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
           :
          Ooh, black and yellow!
          Let's shake it up a little.

          (Through phone)
          - Barry?
          BARRY:
          - Adam?
          ADAM:
          - Can you believe this is happening?
          BARRY:
          - I can't. I'll pick you up.
          (Barry flies down the stairs)
           :
          MARTIN BENSON:
          Looking sharp.
          JANET:
          Use the stairs. Your father
          paid good money for those.
          BARRY:
          Sorry. I'm excited.
          MARTIN:
          Here's the graduate.
          We're very proud of you, son.
           :
          A perfect report card, all B's.
          JANET:
          Very proud.
          (Rubs Barry's hair)
          BARRY=
          Ma! I got a thing going here.
          JANET:
          - You got lint on your fuzz.
          BARRY:
          - Ow! That's me!
          
          JANET:
          - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
          - Bye!
          (Barry flies out the door)
          JANET:
          Barry, I told you,
          stop flying in the house!
          (Barry drives through the hive,and is waved at by Adam who is reading a
          newspaper)
          BARRY==
          - Hey, Adam.
          ADAM:
          - Hey, Barry.
          (Adam gets in Barry's car)
           :
          - Is that fuzz gel?
          BARRY:
          - A little. Special day, graduation.
          ADAM:
          Never thought I'd make it.
          (Barry pulls away from the house and continues driving)
          BARRY:
          Three days grade school,
          three days high school...
          ADAM:
          Those were awkward.
          BARRY:
          Three days college. I'm glad I took
          a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
          ADAM==
          You did come back different.
          (Barry and Adam pass by Artie, who is jogging)
          ARTIE:
          - Hi, Barry!
          
          BARRY:
          - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
          ADAM:
          - Hear about Frankie?
          BARRY:
          - Yeah.
          ADAM==
          - You going to the funeral?
          BARRY:
          - No, I'm not going to his funeral.
           :
          Everybody knows,
          sting someone, you die.
           :
          Don't waste it on a squirrel.
          Such a hothead.
          ADAM:
          I guess he could have
          just gotten out of the way.
          (The car does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and lands on the
          highway)
           :
          I love this incorporating
          an amusement park into our regular day.
          BARRY:
          I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.
          (Barry parallel parks the car and together they fly over the graduating
          students)
          Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
          under the circumstances.
          (Barry and Adam sit down and put on their hats)
           :
          - Well, Adam, today we are men.
          
          ADAM:
          - We are!
          BARRY=
          - Bee-men.
          =ADAM=
          - Amen!

          BARRY:
          - Ow! That's me!
          
          JANET:
          - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
          - Bye!
          (Barry flies out the door)
          JANET:
          Barry, I told you,
          stop flying in the house!
          (Barry drives through the hive,and is waved at by Adam who is reading a
          newspaper)
          BARRY==
          - Hey, Adam.
          ADAM:
          - Hey, Barry.
          (Adam gets in Barry's car)
           :
          - Is that fuzz gel?
          BARRY:
          - A little. Special day, graduation.
          ADAM:
          Never thought I'd make it.
          (Barry pulls away from the house and continues driving)
          BARRY:
          Three days grade school,
          three days high school...
          ADAM:
          Those were awkward.
          BARRY:
          Three days college. I'm glad I took
          a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
          ADAM==
          You did come back different.
          (Barry and Adam pass by Artie, who is jogging)
          ARTIE:
          - Hi, Barry!
          
          BARRY:
          - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
          ADAM:
          - Hear about Frankie?
          BARRY:
          - Yeah.

           :
          Don't waste it on a squirrel.
          Such a hothead.
          ADAM:
          I guess he could have
          just gotten out of the way.
          (The car does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and lands on the
          highway)
           :
          I love this incorporating
          an amusement park into our regular day.
          BARRY:
          I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.
          (Barry parallel parks the car and together they fly over the graduating
          students)
          Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
          under the circumstances.
          (Barry and Adam sit down and put on their hats)
           :
          - Well, Adam, today we are men.
          
          ADAM:

           :
          Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
          Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
           :
          Our top-secret formula

           :
          into this soothing sweet syrup

          golden glow you know as...
          EVERYONE ON BUS:
          Honey!
          (The guide has been collecting honey into a bottle and she throws it into
          the crowd on the bus and it is caught by a girl in the back)
          ADAM:
          - That girl was hot.
          BARRY:
          - She's my cousin!
          ADAM==
          - She is?
          BARRY:
          - Yes, we're all cousins.

          These bees are stress-testing
          a new helmet technology.
          (The bus passes by a Bee wearing a helmet who is being smashed into the
          ground with fly-swatters, newspapers and boots. He lifts a thumbs up but
          you can hear him groan)
           :
          ADAM==
          
          - What do you think he makes?

          Saves us millions.
          ADAM:
          (Intrigued)
          Can anyone work on the Krelman?
          TOUR GUIDE:
          Of course. Most bee jobs are
          small ones.
          But bees know that every small job,
          if it's done well, means a lot.
           :
          But choose carefully
           :
          because you'll stay in the job
          you pick for the rest of your life.
          (Everyone claps except for Barry)
          BARRY:
          The same job the rest of your life?
          I didn't know that.
          ADAM:
          
          What's the difference?
          TOUR GUIDE:
          You'll be happy to know that bees,
          as a species, haven't had one day off
           :
          in 27 million years.
          BARRY:
          (Upset)
          So you'll just work us to death?
           :
          We'll sure try.
          (Everyone on the bus laughs except Barry. Barry and Adam are walking back
          home together)
          ADAM:
          Wow! That blew my mind!
          BARRY:
          "What's the difference?"
          How can you say that?
           :
          One job forever?
          That's an insane choice to have to make.</div>
